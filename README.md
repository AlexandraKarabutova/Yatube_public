## Project Description:
A social network project built using the Django framework.

### The project includes the following features:
* Anonymous users can view posts from authors in a feed format, view detailed information about each post, groups, and author pages, and perform site-wide searches.
* Registration, login to the site, password change, and account recovery with confirmation via email are available.
* Authenticated users can publish and delete their own posts, leave comments, and subscribe to other authors (adding them to favorites).
* When adding posts, it is mandatory to provide text content, while adding a group and image is optional.
